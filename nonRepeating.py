Problem: First Non-Repeating Character (Index)

Write a function that takes a string s and returns the index of the first character that appears only once in the string.

If no such character exists, return -1.

Rules

Characters are case-sensitive ('a' ≠ 'A')

Return the index, not the character

The order of the string matters

Examples

Input:
s = "leetcode"

Output:
0
('l' appears once and is first)

Input:
s = "loveleetcode"

Output:
2
('v' is the first non-repeating character)

Input:
s = "aabb"

Output:
-1
